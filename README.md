# Cars-Datasets-2025-from-Kaggle

I have meticulously compiled a comprehensive dataset on cars companies, models, engines, CC/battery capacities, horsepower, top speed, 0-100 km/h performance, prices (in US dollars), fuel types, seating capacity, and torque. This dataset is designed to serve car enthusiasts, automotive analysts, and students, enabling them to stay informed, conduct research, and work on impactful projects. Committed to supporting the global automotive community, I aim to continually enhance and expand this resource to empower innovation and informed decision making
